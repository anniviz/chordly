{title:The Lord Will March Out}
{key:D}

The [C]Lord will march out like a [G]mighty [C]man
Like a [Am]warrior getting [F]ready for the battle He will [F]stir [G]His [C]zeal  (2x)

With a [Am]shout He will raise the [F]battle cry
With a [Am]shout, with a shout, with a mighty [G]shout
And will [Am]triumph over His [F]enemies
With a [Am]shout, with a shout
With a mighty [G]shou[Dm]-ou[G]-out, with a mighty [C]shout

JESUS
