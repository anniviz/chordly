{st:Tim Hughes}

1. [E]Light of the [H]world, You stepped [Fism]down into darkness
[E]Opened my [H]eyes, let me [A2]see
[E]Beauty that [H]made this [Fism]heart adore You
[E]Hope of a [H]life spent with [A2]You

{soc}
Here I am to [E]worship, here I am to[H/Dis] bow down
Here I am to [E]say that You're my [A2]God
You're altogether [E]lovely, altogether[H/Dis] worthy
Altogether [E/Gis]wonderful to [A]me  [A2]
{eoc}

2. King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

B. And Iâ€™ll[H/Dis] never  [E/Gis] know how [A]much it cost to[H/Dis] see my[E/Gis] sin u[A]pon that cross
